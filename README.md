# Memory Game 

## A JavaScript Game

This is a website designed to deliver a JavaScript game to the user. 

This game is accessible to all, and has two aims in mind: to be fun to play the first time, and to encourage replayability.

 There is a high score function that stores the longest run score, enabling replayability. The site is targeted primarily at anyone who wishes to play the game, and exists solely for this game. 
 
The game will be designed to work on all screens, and should be responsive as the page is resized. 

The site is designed to work on three different screen sizes, including Desktop, Tablet and Phone sizes.


## Game Concept
With inspiration drawn from the very succesful game Simon. Which is an electronic game of short-term memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, working for toy design firm Marvin Glass and Associates, with software programming by Lenny Cope. First brought to market in 1978, The device created a series of tones and lights and required a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails or the time limit runs out, the game is over.


The site is designed to work on three different screen sizes, including Desktop, Tablet and Phone sizes.

## Technology
+ This website was made in its entirety using Visual Code Studio
+ Wireframe and prototyping images were made in Figma
+ Additional software used to create this website include Chrome for previewing, inspecting and bug testing

## Testing
### Test Case: TDD Developement
+ !["Test Examples]()

### Test Case: Developer tools
+ Click outside game space; should have no effect on game.

+ The game space should have 4 equal sized circles that the user can click and is obvious when clicked.

+ The game space should also have a new game button.

+ When the game is active: hovering over any of the four circles at any time should make the circle grow slightly.

+ When the game is active: The highscore box should add up for every correct sequence.

+ When the game is active: the circle should light up clearly to the user.

+ When the game is active: there should be enough time between each light up of the circles. 

+ When the game is active: If the incorrect button is pressed then the alert box should show displaying a message such as "Try again!" and a new game starts.

+ When the game is active: 

### Bugs discovered
+ Properly aligning the circle buttons was very important as this was the main interaction with the user. Ultimately I solved this with putting two circles on a row each instead of trying to align them in one section.

+ Had to change the alignment fro smaller screens . . . upon doing this led to alignment issues but fixed with flex direction: coloum in the body CSS

+ had to change the hover function as it didnt look right on touch screens . . .
